## Reflection
  - We wanted to design an single page application that utilized a login and recipe modal to reduce page hopping. Additionally, we wanted the users to be able to create, delete, and edit recipes. 
  - We learned how to use modals, creating formData objects to send to the backend, and some new styling techniques!
  - This was our first big project including multiple teams, so managing that was tricky.
